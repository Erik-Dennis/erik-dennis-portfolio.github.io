            <p class="Description" id="FileServerDescription">
                What started off as a simple File Sharing server (NAS) has morphed to have many jobs over the past few years.
                Sometimes hosting game servers other times hosting docker containers and of course hosting a samba share. 

                As of the time of writing this, this machine is running a bare metal installation of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
                On top of the OS it is hosting a 1TB samba file share, two game servers, and a few Docker containers.

                <br>
                <b>File Share:</b> This is used for backups and file transfers between machines and between installations of
                Windows and Linux for various projects from websites to code to ripped ROMs and Movies from physically owned media.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Game Servers:</b> These mostly consist of Minecraft and Palworld for family members and friends locally but eventually
                I would love to scale these to being open across WAN or VPN with whitelists, a segmented (air-gaped) VLAN or DMZ 
                and some implementation of a reverse proxy for ‘screening’.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Docker Containers:</b> I am running Portainer as a web UI to manage my Docker containers and Docker Compose stacks,
                Plex for streaming ripped DVDs, Heimdall for a dashboard to easily navigate to all of the hosted services,
                and Uptime Kuma for monitoring uptime of services and notifying me if any of them go down.
