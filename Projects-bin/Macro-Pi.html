                    <p>
                        The Macro Pi is a project that I built using a combination of a Raspberry Pi 4 (64 bit, 4 core CPU, <br>
                        4GB RAM, with a wireless card for 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth), a 3.5 inch LCD screen/case that <br>
                        attached to the GP I/O pins, and some python and bash scripting. While the hardware may be a little <br>
                        overkill for something this small of scale the end result was quite nice. <br>
                        
                        <br>

                        The Macro Pi utilizes the os.system() function to interact with the system terminal. It then calls <br>
                        the screen command with the argument -S to name the screen and -dm to detach the screen from the <br>
                        current terminal session as referred to in the <a class="BodyLink" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/">documentation</a>. <br>

                        <br>

                        The GUI was created with the tkinter library and programs are called on button press. An example of <br>
                        the Steam Flatpak being called looks something like this: <br>

                        <br>

                            def steam(): <br>
                                os.system(‘screen -S Steam -dm ssh localServerIP “export DISPLAY=serverSessionNumber && flatpak run com.valvesoftware.Steam”’) <br>

                                <br>

                        and then the function steam being passed through to the command variable in the ttk.Button: <br>

                        <br>

                            ttk.Button(frm, text=”Steam”, command=steam).grid(column=1, row=2) <br>

                        <br>

                        The portion “export DISPLAY=” needs to be set to the tty session of the server which can be found <br>
                        by running the “w” command in the terminal. For my personal configuration the tty session is “:1” <br>
                        so it would look like “export DISPLAY=:1”. This allows the graphical application to open on the <br>
                        server rather than on the client. In this case without exporting the display the application would <br>
                        attempt to open on the Raspberry Pi instead of opening on the laptop or desktop you are trying to <br>
                        control. <br>
